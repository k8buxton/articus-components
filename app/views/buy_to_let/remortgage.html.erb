        <p>
          If you have previously lived in a property but would now like to let it out as a rental, you’ll need to remortgage for buy to let purposes. We regularly work with clients who are moving away or even abroad for work and would like to remortgage a property they already own from residential to buy to let. Likewise, we often work with individuals who are moving into a larger property – perhaps to accommodate a growing family – and would like to keep their existing property on as an investment.

        <p>
          The likelihood is that it would violate the terms of your residential mortgage to operate your property as a rental. While this can be confusing, especially for inexperienced landlords, this is a fairly common process.

        <p>
          Our brokers have plenty of experience with this situation and can ensure that transforming your home into a buy to let is a smooth process – even when the mortgage in question is a large one.
