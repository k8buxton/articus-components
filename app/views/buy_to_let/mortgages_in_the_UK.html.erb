        </p>
        <p>
          Across the board, buy to let mortgages have become more challenging to secure in recent years, due to increasingly stringent affordability guidelines and regulations.

        <p class="title">What you need to know about buy to let mortgages in the UK</p>
        <p>
          Mainstream lenders will have similar buy to let mortgage criteria. For example, many will cap out their lending at 75% loan to value (LTV), while for casual landlords, some lenders will expect you to have a minimum annual salary outside of any expected rental income. Buy to let mortgage fees are often higher upfront, too.

          A number of changes have impacted the availability of buy to let mortgage deals.
