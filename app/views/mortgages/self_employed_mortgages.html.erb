          Self-employed mortgages can undoubtedly be confusing – and in recent years, mortgages for self-employed people have become more difficult to arrange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike salaried employees, self-employed workers – including freelancers and contractors – often struggle to walk into a bank and secure property finance. This is always frustrating, but even more so for those with an income that would otherwise enable them to acquire a large mortgage with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the financial crisis, self-employed workers could apply for a ‘self-certification’ mortgage, which enabled individuals to simply tell lenders what they earned. Often, checks were far from stringent, and the practice has subsequently been banned.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s now much more difficult to secure a mortgage as a self-employed person, and many such individuals find they are unable to borrow the amount they require when it comes time to purchase or remortgage a property.
        </p>
        <p class="title">How do mortgages for self-employed people work?</p>
        <p>
          Wondering how mortgages for self-employed people work? To start with, it isn’t true that you’ll need to seek out an explicitly ‘self-employed mortgage’ product. However, mortgages for self-employed people are calculated differently to traditional salaried employees, particularly in terms of affordability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, to secure a mortgage as a self-employed person, you’ll need two years’ worth of accounts, a consistent track record of regular income, a large deposit, and a strong credit history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most lenders will consider your average earnings over a period of several years to judge your affordability and assess how much you can feasibly borrow. An accountant is invaluable here, particularly since you’ll need up-to-date files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your application will also be affected by the way you structure your own employment. Whether you’re a sole trader or the director of a limited company, you’ll be assessed slightly differently by banks.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Why should you use a broker to arrange a self-employed mortgage?</p>
        <p>
          When on the hunt for the best self-employed mortgage rates, most self-employed people can benefit from working with an experienced mortgage broker. And this is especially true if you have any nuances in your case, such as only having been self-employed for a short time, having a gap in your income history, or requiring a large mortgage with a high loan to value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using our extensive experience and network of industry contacts, we can help you to secure excellent terms on a self-employed mortgage, even if your case is unusual. For example, if you’ve worked for ten years in Financial Services, and are now a contractor in the same area with less than two years’ accounts, we work with lenders who can assist you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We even have experience helping to arrange mortgages for people who are self-employed without accounts, because they’ve only recently made the move. In short, whatever your specific self-employed situation, we have the experience to help.
