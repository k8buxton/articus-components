          Looking for a high loan to value mortgage? Many borrowers, including high net worth individuals (HNWIs), are keen to maintain their personal liquidity and therefore hope to secure a mortgage with a low deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with many banks unwilling to offer mortgages above 80% loan to value – and most high loan to value mortgage deals coming with equally high interest rates attached – it’s important to seek specialist advice and consider all of the options, to ensure you receive the best possible deal.
        </p>
        <p class="title">What is a high loan to value mortgage?</p>
        <p>
          A high loan to value mortgage is a mortgage with a low deposit in proportion to the size of the loan. Generally, high loan to value mortgages refer to mortgages at around 80% of the property value or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is significant because the loan to value ratio is used by lenders to assess the level of lending risk. This means if you’re looking to purchase a property valued at £1 million, a deposit of even £200,000 or less would typically be considered a high loan to value mortgage.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Should you get a high loan to value mortgage?</p>
        <p>
          The question of whether you should get a high loan to value mortgage is a personal one, and will always depend on your exact circumstances. It may be the case that you would prefer to maintain your liquidity for other strategic investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you may find that you can secure cheaper borrowing if you are willing to pursue a lower loan to value mortgage. Ultimately, although it is more difficult to secure a mortgage with a small deposit or minimal equity within a property, it’s far from impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="title">Why is it difficult to get a high loan to value mortgage? </p>
        <p>
          Not all banks are willing to offer high loan to value mortgages, and your ability to secure one will depend on a number of factors. From a lender’s perspective, high loan to value mortgages are more of a risk. As such, the rate you will pay on such a loan will typically be higher, or you may have to place additional collateral.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve a competitive rate on a high loan to value mortgage, you will likely need the assistance of an experienced intermediary with a strong network of industry contacts.
